# New Website for the Margaret Bell School
 
The Margaret Bell School works with orphans and disadvantaged children in Kitwe, the second largest city in Zambia. I first came into contact with the school in 2005, when they asked me to help them with setting up a website. I did so voluntarily as a contribution to their work and the site has now been online for more than twelve years.

Between 2005 and 2017 the site underwent some redesigning, before the current redesign began in January 2018. The site is a simple six-page responsive static website, designed according to mobile-first principles. It is primarily built in HTML and CSS, with small amounts of JavaScript in the menu and photo gallery.
