				Welcome to the official website of the Margaret Bell School in Kitwe, Zambia.

			<p>
				The Margaret Bell School is a Christian pre-school and primary school situated in Kitwe's Chimwemwe sub-urban area. The school lies about 10 km to the north of the town centre. Lying in the copperbelt in the north of the country, Kitwe is an important centre for copper mining and has a population of approximately 400,000. Currently there are more than three hundred children attending the school.
			</p>

			<p>
				The mission of the school is to provide a sound education, food, clothes and primary health care to the orphaned and the very poor children of our society. The school's long term desire is to provide acommodation for children in the school premises, but at present there are no facilities to do this.
			</p>

			<p>
				This site enables you to find out more about the Margaret Bell School; the work we are doing in Kitwe and the community we are working in. If you would like to make a donation to our work, this can be done by bank transfer to our accounts in either the United Kingdom or in Zambia. For further details, please e-mail the school.
