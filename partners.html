		<h2>OVERSEAS PARTNERS</h2>

		<h3>United Kingdom</h3>

		<p>
			We are very grateful for all the support given to us over the years by Margaret Bell. The school is now registered as a charity in the United Kingdom (Charity Number: 1151747) and various fundraising events have been staged. The charity is trying to raise funds so that we can buy land and build our own school building, class rooms, offices, toilets, bath rooms and school hall. A charity day was held at Ascot Racecourse, some pictures of which are available below. Please click on a thumbnail picture to see the full size photo.
		</p>

		<p>
			In 2007, Ridgeway Methodist Church in the UK raised Â£1,000 in funds to support our work.
		</p>

		<h3>United States</h3>

		<p>
			Early in 2014, Ethan Njorege, from Carthbet High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, donated educational books and a few bibles to the Margaret Bell School. We are very grateful to Ethan for his support.
		</p>

		<p>
			We have also acquired 30 very affordable laptops and computers from 'World Computer Exchange' in the USA. The computers will be used to help the children have computer literacy and also will help other children from surounding communities with computer knowledge, giving the school its own computer centre for the first time.
		</p>

		<p>
			This centre will give free computer lessons to qualifying children and then will also ask for a fee to those families who can afford to pay for lessons. It will also provide internet services not only to children, but also to the public at large.
